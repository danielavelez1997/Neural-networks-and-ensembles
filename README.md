# Neural-networks-and-ensembles
The data use for the project is in this link https://mimic.physionet.org/.The target to predict is the Length of Stay (LOS column, in days) in a ICU based on patient-related characteristics and the metric that i am considering is the RMSE, to solve this regression problem i  am using neural networks with sklearn and keras. Also i do an ensemble with SVR, knn,random forest, xgboost and lasso.
